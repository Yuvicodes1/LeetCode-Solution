# 35. Search Insert Position

Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/description

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4

## Intution : we apply binary search and lower bound concept, if found, we return mid, else when arr[mid] < target </br> then low=mid+1; (we can also have an lb variable storing l)
else high=mid-1;

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int searchInsert(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int h = nums.size() - 1;
        int l = 0;
        while (l <= h) {
            int m = (l + h) / 2;
            if (nums[m] == target)
                return m;
            else if (nums[m] < target) {
                l = m + 1;
            } else
                h = m - 1;
        }
        return l;
    }
};
```

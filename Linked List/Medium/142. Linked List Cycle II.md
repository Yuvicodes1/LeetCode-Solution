# 142. Linked List Cycle II

https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/

# Intuition
We use Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm â€” a two-pointer technique that:

First detects if a cycle exists.

Then, finds the entry point of the cycle.

ðŸŒ€ Why does the reset trick work?
After they meet inside the cycle, the distance from the head to the cycle start is equal to the distance from the meeting point to the cycle start (along the cycle). This is proven mathematically by analyzing the number of steps each pointer takes.

# Approach
Move slow one step at a time.

Move fast two steps at a time.

If there is a cycle, slow and fast will eventually meet inside the cycle. Reset Slow to Head and check agan

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
        if (head==nullptr or head->next==nullptr) return nullptr;
        ListNode* slow=head;
        ListNode* fast=head;
        while(fast!=nullptr && fast->next!=nullptr){
            slow=slow->next;
            fast=fast->next->next;
            if(slow==fast){
                slow=head;
                while(slow!=fast){
                    slow=slow->next;
                    fast=fast->next;
                }
                return slow;
            }

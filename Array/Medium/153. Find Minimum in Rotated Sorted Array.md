# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

# Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.size() - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }

        return nums[left];
    }
};
```

# Intution
## Key Observations

A rotated sorted array is composed of two sorted subarrays. The minimum element is the point of rotation and is always the only element smaller than its previous.
Since the array is still partially sorted, we can leverage binary search to locate the minimum in O(log n) time.

## üîç Algorithm Intuition
We use a binary search approach to find the minimum:

Initialize two pointers: left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1.

While left < right:

Calculate the middle index: mid = left + (right - left) / 2.

If nums[mid] > nums[right], the minimum must be to the right of mid.
‚û§ Move left to mid + 1.
Otherwise, the minimum is at mid or to its left.
‚û§ Move right to mid.
At the end, left == right, pointing to the minimum element.

üí° Why It Works
If the middle element is greater than the rightmost, it means the smallest value lies in the right half (as the inflection point hasn‚Äôt been crossed yet).
If nums[mid] <= nums[right], the right half is sorted, and the minimum lies in the left half including mid.

This strategy efficiently narrows down the search window until the minimum is found.
